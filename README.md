1) We came up with this idea to do a thorough Analysis on a player who has the potential to clinch more Wins, but for certain aspects he has brought down his game and in turn loosing his position from World Rank 1.

2) Taking each Errors into consideration, we have focused our Analysis on specific Errors which can improve his game and make him get back on track.

3) Upon reaching a conclusion, we have brought down our analysis to two errors in general:
a) Smash_Return_Error
b) Cross_Smash_Error

4) From above we have found the major Errors which has cost his games at times to loose points in each Set.

5) We have also found a particular Opponent Mr. Axelsen has Lost to on numerous Occasions and to which specific error has cost his game plan.
